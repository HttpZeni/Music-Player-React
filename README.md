# Basic Music Player 🎵

It's my first **React** project and it's a simple music player that lets you play songs, adjust volume, and even add your own music with custom covers.  
It uses **react-slick** for a smooth carousel view of the songs.

You can test it on this **[Website](https://httpzeni.github.io/Music-Player-React/)**
